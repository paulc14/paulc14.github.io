     <h1>Merry XMas David!</h1>
     <h3>Thank you for everything and for putting up with my antics over the years.</h3>
     <p>When you are ready, just give me your personal email address to transfer ownership of the domain over to you. If you want to use another service other than NameCheap, let me know so I can get the ball rolling on that process within NameCheap.</p>
     <p>This domain is good for 2 years, and will come up for renewal in 2026.</p>
     <p>I know it's not uzeal[dot]com, as that was a tad bit out of my price range to get for you. Hopefully this is just as good.</p>
     <p>Have fun!</p>
